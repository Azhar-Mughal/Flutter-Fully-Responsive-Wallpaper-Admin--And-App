# Flutter-Fully-Responsive-Wallpaper-Admin--And-App

Today I share an Walpapers Admin panel UI built with flutter. Now you can build your app dashboard using flutter. This UI contains almost everything that you need like a grid,side menu , nice small view for showing walpaper info. It works perfectly on the Web,Tablet also on both Android and iOS phones. It's time to code once run everywhere. Yeah, Flutter web is not SEO friendly but we don't need SEO for the admin panel.
